# Solr and Plone - Search and Beyond

exclude: true

# Outline

---

# What is Solr?

*   Lucene indexing and search engine
*   Plus HTTP interface, caching, replication etc.
*   Open Source

???

*   Lucene Core
    *   Java-based indexing and search engine
*   Solr
    *   high performance search server
    *   XML/JSON over HTTP
    *   caching, replication, web admin interface, etc.
*   Apache - Open Source

---

exclude: true

# Using Solr

Demo

---

# Connecting Solr to Plone

*   Why?
    *   Speed
    *   Features

???

*   Why?
    *   Speed
        *   portal_catalog is faster than objects
        *   but has its limits
    *   Features
        *   Faceting
        *   Highlighting
        *   Complex queries
        *   Cross-site search
        *   etc.

---

# Connecting Solr to Plone

*   How?
    *   collective.solr
    *   alm.solrindex
    *   scorched & ploneintranet.search

---

# collective.solr

*   Indexes both in catalog and solr (`collective.indexing`)
*   If SearchableText is in the query, divert to Solr


---

exclude: true

# collective.solr

*   Generalisation: Required query parameters
*   May be empty - always use solr

![Required query parameters](required-query-parameters-01.png)

---

# alm.solrindex

* Implements single index with a Solr connector

---

# scorched

*   low-level Solr API
    *   more powerful
    *   less convenient

???

```python
In [1]: si.query(SearchableText='test')
```

---

# ploneintranet.search

*   Based on scorched
*   Tuned towards Plone/Ploneintranet

---

# Features

*   Boosting
*   Highlighting
*   Cross-site search

---

# Boosting

*Take Control over your Search Results*

*    A good search shows the most relevant results first

--
*    Solr results are sorted by score

--
*    Influence score via boosting

--
*    Example: Date boost - recently added/modified content scores higher

```
recip(ms(NOW/HOUR, modified), 3.16e-11, 0.08, 0.05)
```

---

# Highlighting

![UniBW Highlighting](unibw-highlighting-01.png)

---

# Highlighting

*Context for your Search Terms*

*    In what connection does this document mention my search term?
*    Solr can deliver snippets containing the search term

???

*   What Google does

--
*    Caveat: SearchableText must be stored (metadata)
*    Explicitly exclude from response

---

exclude: true

# Faceting

![Recensio browsing](recensio-browsing-01.png)

---

exclude: true

# Faceting

*   Drill down to improve initial results
*   Numbers indicate new number of results

---

## Cross-Site Search

*Search all your Content in one Place*

*   There's more than just your Plone site
*   What if the user doesn't know where the information is?

--
*   Index multiple sources into same Solr
    *   Other Plone sites
    *   Arbitrary sites with Nutch
--
*   Tweak query to search for all paths (not only /Plone)
*   Tweak results page to get external links right

---

# Cross-Site Search

![UniBW Cross-Site Search](unibw-cross-site-01.png)

---

exclude: true

# Complex Queries

*Formulate precisely what you want to find*

*   Give me all items that
    *   are inside Folder A *OR* are tagged with T

        *AND*

    *   have been modified within the last week *OR* created within the last month

--

exclude: true

*   Catalog has hard rules (*AND* for keys, *OR* for values)
*   Solr has flexible query language (AND/OR/NOT, parentheses, ...)

???

Real-world example?

---

# Potential Pitfalls

*   Network overhead
*   transaction integrity
*   Commits are slow

---

exclude: true

# Batching

*   Solr does proper batching
*   May take some getting used to

---

# Network overhead

*   Index processing time vs. network time
*   With a local Solr you should be fine

???

* Exclude SearchableText

---

# Transaction integrity

*   Basic transaction support in c.indexing
*   Sometimes Solr gets out of sync

---

# Commits are slow

*   Optimised for lookup

--
*   Asynchronous commits
*   Delay in index update

???

* Calendar view
* Create event takes you back to calendar
* Generated from Solr
* Not up to date after creating event

---

# Summary

*   Several methods of connecting
*   Awesome features
*   Some costs and risks

--

*Should I use Solr?*

* Fast query, slow indexing
* Large site
* Features

???

* If you subscribe to "query should be fast, indexing can take time"
* If your site is large
* If any of the features are of value to you
